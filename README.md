     that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

- I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
     I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

## Usage

Run npm install , to install all packages. To run tests do `npm run test` in the command line to run all. To run a specific test, give a specific name ex: `npm run test manager`. To open the question prompts, in the command line, use `node index.js` and select answers. This should generate a file in the /dist folder with your generated html.
